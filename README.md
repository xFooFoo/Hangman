# Hangman
Hangman game that tells you the definition of the word at game completion.

**CUSTOMIZE THE GAME:**
- You can use your own list of words by updating the file path and the delimiter of how each word is split (space, new line, comma?).
- Adjust MAX_GUESSES to the number of guesses allowed in each game.

The game is currently text-based and I will look into embedding the game onto a GUI using Tkinter.

Created by xFooFoo using Python with PyDictionary module to retrieve word definitions.
